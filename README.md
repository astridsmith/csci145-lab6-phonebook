## Bellingham Phonebook

This application creates a prepopulated phonebook and alows the user to view, add, and delete entries. 

✅ The Main class has an option chooser and prepopulates the phonebook

✅ The (object) Contact class creates the basic structure of the contact entries in the phonebook

✅ The phonebook manager allows for reading, writing, and searching the phone book, as well as serves as the point that the linked list `phoneBook` is created

## What I'd like to do in the future:

[] Make the search funtion work with more fields (like phone #, adress, etc) and to not need exact case

[] Make the search function match partial input (like 1/2 of a word)
